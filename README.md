# AI Project Manager

A comprehensive, intelligent project management platform that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance traditional project management processes. This system uses AI to provide smarter task estimation, workflow optimization, and resource management for teams of all sizes.

## Project Purpose

The AI Project Manager is designed to solve common project management challenges by applying artificial intelligence to:

1. **Reduce Project Delays**: Improve timeline estimation and early detection of potential blockers
2. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Intelligently assign tasks based on team member workload and skills
3. **Enhance Decision Making**: Provide data-driven insights for project planning and execution
4. **Automate Routine Work**: Generate task suggestions and project documentation automatically
5. **Improve Visibility**: Offer predictive analytics on project health and potential risks

## Features

- **AI-Powered Task Estimation**: Predicts task completion time based on priority, status, and complexity
- **Smart Task Suggestions**: Automatically suggests relevant tasks based on project type and status
- **Workflow Optimization**: Analyzes project structure to suggest improvements in task sequencing and resource allocation
- **Project Timeline Prediction**: Forecasts project completion dates based on current progress and historical data
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure access management with different user roles (admin/user)
- **Robust Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure password handling
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all data inputs to ensure integrity
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse with customized rate limits for different endpoints
- **API Documentation**: Interactive Swagger documentation for all endpoints

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with JavaScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js
